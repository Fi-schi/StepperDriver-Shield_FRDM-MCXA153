# StepperDriver-Shield_FRDM-MCXA153

This is a shield for the FRDM-MCXA153 microcontroller, developed as part of a project at the Hochschule Wismar, University of Applied Sciences: Technology, Economy and Design.

The board acts as a carrier for the TMC-2209 stepper drivers and allows up to four stepper motors to be controlled simultaneously.

It is designed for 24V operation and has three freely programmable buttons, connections for four limit switches and a manual stepper driver enable circuit.
In addition, by soldering a DC-DC converter to the microcontroller, it is possible to supply 24V through the shield.
